# Business-Analytics-Requirements-Checklist
Your business analytics solution should support existing and future business needs. It is vital to document core business objectives and outcomes. Then break down the objectives into measurable analytics goals. Finally, choose a platform that helps you achieve your goals.

### Provide an Intuitive User Interface
You will refer to the business analytics platform while making key decisions. So, the solution should provide robust self-service analytics capabilities and a user-friendly interface. Non-technical users should be able to create and understand reports and dashboards easily.

### Facilitate Advanced Analytics
The business analytics solution should recognize data patterns and trends while predicting future events and outcomes. Build advanced statistical models to make accurate forecasts.

### Offer Mobility
Mobile analytics is an effective way to keep everyone in the organization connected. Global companies need to be able to make data-driven decisions on the go. Before considering solutions, make sure you ponder the following questions:

- What kind of mobile analytics capabilities do you need?
- Do you need to view dashboards and reports or create and edit them on the fly?
- Mobile BI facilitates collaboration and boosts user adoption rates.

### Obtain Data From Multiple Sources
Modern analytics solutions combine and analyze multiple complex data sources, including structured, semi-structured and unstructured. With the ability to combine data from a variety of sources onto a single dashboard, these solutions provide a complete view of business performance.

### Provide Integration
While selecting a solution, decide whether a standalone or an integrated system is apt for your business. Integrated platforms offer access to existing analytics capabilities that users understand. You must gauge how easily an analytics platform can integrate with the existing solution and third-party sources.

### Key Requirements
The following is a checklist of important business analytics requirements:

1. Advanced Analytics
Advanced analytics is an umbrella term for a wide range of analytics techniques that make use of cutting-edge computing techniques such as machine learning. It refers to the autonomous examination of data using techniques beyond those offered by more basic BI. The goal of advanced analytics is to discover insights, make predictions or generate recommendations for improving business.
Some features included involve structuring unstructured data with text and statistical analysis. Explore and analyze vast amounts of unstructured text data to identify concepts, patterns, keywords and other attributes through text analytics capabilities.
Generate a regression model that describes and analyzes relationships between dependent and independent variables and leverage it to make accurate predictions. It supports different types of regression analysis such as linear, logistic, exponential, polynomial and multivariate.
Leverage scenario and what-if analysis to compare different scenarios and their potential outcomes based on dynamic parameters or values. Forecast future trends based on present and past data using forecasting methods like exponential smoothing, moving averages, ARIMA, SARIMA and more.
